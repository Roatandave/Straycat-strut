# Work-in-progress

This is an installable zip for cyanogenmod 13 [marshmallow] now called lineageos.
Or you can remove the zImage from it and put it in your Nethunter build to make the full
package.

NethunterOS ==>ROM<== based on cyanogenmod 14.1 [android 7 nougat] is being worked on.
This is not the install package but a full version android rom.
